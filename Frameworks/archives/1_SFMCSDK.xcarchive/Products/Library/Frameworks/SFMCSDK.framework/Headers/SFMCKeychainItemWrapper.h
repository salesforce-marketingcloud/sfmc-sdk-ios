/**
 This class is left to remain non-ARC INTENTIONALLY!
 
 There is a known issue reported by many developers on Apple Developer Forum and
 Github, detailing an issue related to error code -34018. Apple acknowledged the
 issue, yet has not provided a solution or workaround, and has not shared much
 about the root cause of the issue. Last reported case was encountered on iOS 9
 beta 2.
 
 The only proven workaround was to keep the class implementation non-ARC.
 
 Until Apple fixes the issue, please DO NOT ARC this class!
